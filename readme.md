**Warning:** this repo is considered public pre-release information. It is in varying levels of completeness, but being provided as a glimpse into our development process. Understand that it may or may not meet our quality standards. If you have questions or comments, please [contact us](mailto:badg@muterra.io).

This document is an *exceptionally* brief overview of the Muse project. If you'd like to know details, you should read our [whitepaper](/whitepaper.md). If you'd like to understand the guts of the project, or to write your own implementation, check out the [yellowpaper](/yellowpaper.md).

In philosophy, the term "agency" describes the ability of an individual "agent" to take independent action -- roughly speaking, it's self-determinacy. And when you and I go online, we have woefully little agency. The second we upload data we forfeit its control; our only other choice is non-participation, and for a lot of people around the world, abstention really isn't an option. Digital agency is something I really, really care about, and the point of the Muse project is to make an economically compelling argument for its importance.

The web today is network-oriented: information flows from machine to machine with no regard to user identity. Websites devote tremendous amounts of resources on implementing user accounts in an attempt to accommodate the reality that, at the end of the day, it's not about what *computer* is connected, but what *person* is. The Muse, in contrast, is agent-oriented: the network itself provides an inherent, universal user account system to allow development to focus directly on creation. This is made possible by a robust privacy protocol and powerful content, identity, and sharing management systems.

In short, the Muse project:

* Uses strong privacy to give people back control over their data
* Helps you always know exactly what you're uploading, who you're sharing it with, and who shared it with you
* Uses a single account for each identity on the network, and optionally supports anonymity through disposable identities
* Behaves consistently and seamlessly for each user, regardless of what device they're using
* Reduces internet operations costs by making hardware truly location-independent
* Reduces application development costs by eliminating site-specific user accounts
* Provides simple, effective, and cheap information security to all Muse applications
* Is designed to meet the 40-billion-plus device scaling demands of the coming Internet of Things
